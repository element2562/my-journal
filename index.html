<h2>Day One</h2>   
<p class="entry"> Today was my first day at NSS and it went 
very well. However, I didn't expect to be thrown right into it.
I enjoy it because there is a challenge to it rather than just
being babied through it. I am excited to see what day two has
in store.</p>
<h2>Day Two</h2>
<p class="entry">In todays activities, I think I have an idea of how this
    class will be formatted. Cohort 25 came in and showed some
    of their projects, which we will be working on 6 weeks from 
    now. It was slightly overwhelming, but it's amazing that we
    will be able to do those things in that short of time.</p>
